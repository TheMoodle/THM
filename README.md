# THM

This repository contains useful scripts/tools that I use on the [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/) rooms.

It also contains [a python setup script](setup.py) to automatically setup a directory with a readme for notes for any room. Call it with the name in the url and it'll setup a directory for you.  

`Usage: setup.py [URL Extension] {Optional: Name of Directory}`

Feel free to edit/improve the script and create a pull request afterward!
